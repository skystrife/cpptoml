# cpptoml
A header-only library for parsing [TOML][toml] configuration files.

Targets: [TOML v0.4.0][currver]
[![Build Status](https://webapi.biicode.com/v1/badges/amalulla/amalulla/cpptoml/master)](https://www.biicode.com/amalulla/cpptoml) 

It is reasonably conforming, with the exception of unicode escape
characters in strings. This includes support for the new DateTime format,
inline tables, multi-line basic and raw strings, and digit separators.

Alternatives:
- [ctoml][ctoml] and [tinytoml][tinytoml] are both C++11 implementations of
  a TOML parser, but only support v0.2.0.
- [libtoml][libtoml] is a C implementation of a TOML parser, which can be
  linked to from your C++ programs easily. It supports only v0.2.0 also.

## Build Status

## Test Results
The following two tests are the only failing tests from [the toml-test
suite][toml-test].

```
Test: string-escapes (valid)

Parsing failed: Invalid escape sequence at line 9

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test: unicode-escape (valid)

Parsing failed: Invalid escape sequence at line 1


76 passed, 2 failed
```

# Compilation
Requires a well conforming C++11 compiler. On OSX this means clang++ with
libc++ and libc++abi (the default clang installed with XCode's command line
tools is sufficient).

On Linux, you should be able to use g++ >= 4.8.x, or clang++ with libc++
and libc++abi (if your package manager supplies this; most don't).

Compiling the examples can be done with cmake:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

Compile it on Linux, OS X and Windows (MinGW 4.9 y Visual Studio 12) with biicode:
```
bii init -L
bii build
```

# Example Usage
See the root directory files `parse.cpp` and `parse_stdin.cpp` for an
example usage.
